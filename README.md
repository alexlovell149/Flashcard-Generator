# Flashcard-Generator
App using Node.js to generate flashcards in terminal

Introducing several commands within your terminal you can use to make flashcards

====================================

Create flashcards dynamically that will add to an array and can be used later. The Basic Ones will provide a question on the front and the answer will be provided on the back. Your answers will be counted as right or wrong and a score will be given at the end. The create cloze cards will allow you to create a sentence and then choose a word to remove for the user to guess when they take the close quiz

===================================

You can do a trial run and take a quiz with questions that already have been created for you with the same concept. The Cloze cards will have a word missing from a sentence and you must fill that sentence. 

ie. "Killing two ____ with one stone" the answer is birds
